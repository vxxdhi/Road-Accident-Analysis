# Road-Accident-Analysis
## Analysing the correlation between the number of casualties and different factors of 6 different junction controls
### This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to uncover insights aimed at improving road safety measures and reducing accident occurrences. The dataset comprises essential details such as accident date, time, location, severity, weather conditions, road type, number of casualties, and vehicles involved. Through rigorous data analysis and visualization techniques, the objective is to identify patterns, trends, and contributing factors to road accidents, ultimately facilitating evidence-based decision-making for policymakers and relevant stakeholders.
QUESTIONS FOR ANALYSIS:

DOES A PARTICULAR DAY IN WEEK DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS?
HOW DOES A LOCATION AFFECT THE NUMBER OF CASUALTIES?
WHICH JUNCTION CONTROLS OR LOCATIONS SAW THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CASUALTIES?
